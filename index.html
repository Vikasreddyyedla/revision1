    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] 
        for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
         It defines the content and structure of web content.
         It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
         and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

         Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[34] 
         Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. 
         It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
         object-oriented and functional programming.</p>
